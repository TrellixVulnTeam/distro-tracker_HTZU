Bugs and new features:
----------------------
See http://bugs.debian.org/tracker.debian.org for almost everything.

* Implement backwards compatibility with X-PTS- fields in the debian
  vendor.

Refactoring:
------------
* Create a generic task downloading data from an URL and transforming it
  into action items.

Misc possible enhancements:
---------------------------
* Paul Wise's input: https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2014/07/msg00092.html
* Codebase is Python 3 compatible but some optional dependencies need to
  be ported:
  - python-soappy (no python3-soappy yet)
  - python-ldap (no python3-ldap, but maybe could be ported to
    python-ldap3?)
* Re-enable a smarter clickjacking protection: only activate it when the
  page is rendered for a logged in user and allow callers to pass a
  "anonymous=1" parameter that will force render the web page as if
  the user was not authenticated. This requires writing a dedicated
  Middleware.
