    <p>You are about to confirm the merge of two PTS accounts.</p>
    <p>All emails currently associated to the account you are logged in with will be moved to the account with the email address {{ confirmation.initial_user.main_email }}. After this, if you wish to log in using any of the emails from this account you will have to use the password of the other account. Additionally, please be aware that this account's account-specific setting will be lost (first name, last name).</p>
