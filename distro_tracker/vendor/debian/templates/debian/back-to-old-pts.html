<p>This package tracker is better than the old one on many aspects
(easy to extend, more dynamic, responsive, packed with new features
such as subscription management on the web, team subscriptions, etc.)
but should you find some features that are lacking or some other problems,
then please file bug reports against the
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/tracker.debian.org">tracker.debian.org</a>
pseudo-package. Also don't hesitate to help us by
<a href="https://qa.pages.debian.net/distro-tracker/contributing.html">contributing
patches</a> for those issues.</p>
Not convinced? Go back to the old <a
href="https://packages.qa.debian.org/{{ package }}">package tracking
system</a>.
