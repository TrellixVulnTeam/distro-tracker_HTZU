{% if status == "NEW" %}
this package has a new version ready in the VCS. You should consider uploading
into the archive.
{% elif status == "COMMITS" %}
this package seems to have new commits in its VCS. You should consider updating
the debian/changelog and uploading this new version into the archive.
{% elif status == "OLD" %}
the current version of the package is not in its VCS.<br/>
Either you need to push your commits, or the information about the package's
VCS are out of date. A common cause of the latter issue when using the Git VCS
is not specifying the correct branch when the packaging is not in the default
one (remote HEAD branch), which is usually "master" but can be modified in
salsa.debian.org in the project's general settings with the "Default
Branch" field). Alternatively the Vcs-Git field in debian/control can
contain a "-b &lt;branch-name&gt;" suffix to indicate what branch is used
for the Debian packaging.
{% elif status == "UNREL" %}
this package has been uploaded into the archive but the debian/changelog in the
VCS is still UNRELEASED.  You should consider pushing the missing commits
or updating the VCS.
{% elif status == "ERROR" %}
there is an error with this package's VCS, or the debian/changelog file inside
it. Please check the error shown below and try to fix it. You might have
to update the VCS URL in the debian/control file to point to the correct
repository.
{% elif status == "DEFAULT" %}
a new type of VCS status has been added.
