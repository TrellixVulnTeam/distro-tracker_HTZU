"""Site-specific settings

This is the file that you should edit to customize the setting of your
PTS installation. By default it imports settings from the ``selected.py``
file which is a symlink to the type of installation to you have
(typically, ``production.py`` or ``development.py``) and lets you add
overrides on top of those type-of-installation-specific settings.
