"""Package Tracking System settings

The settings are created dynamically by first importing defaults
values from :py:mod:`distro_tracker.project.settings.defaults` and then
values :py:mod:`distro_tracker.project.settings.local`. The test suite
is special cased and doesn't use the latter, instead it uses
:py:mod:`distro_tracker.project.settings.test`.
