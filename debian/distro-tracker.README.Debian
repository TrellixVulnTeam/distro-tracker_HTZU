Notes concerning the distro-tracker Debian package
--------------------------------------------------

Initial setup
-------------

The package does quite some work for you but you still have some things
to take care of:

1/ by default, the package is configured to use a PostgreSQL database
   using the default local unix socket and the authentication is done at
   the user level. The package creates a "distro-tracker" Unix account,
   you must create a "distro-tracker" database that can be managed by the
   "distro-tracker" user. You can do this with:

   $ sudo -u postgres createuser -D -R -S distro-tracker
   $ sudo -u postgres createdb -O distro-tracker distro-tracker

   If the default database configuration doesn't suit you, go
   edit /etc/distro-tracker/settings/db_postgresql.py.

2/ the Distro Tracker has many configuration options, you should review
   its documentation and /etc/distro-tracker/settings/* and update
   /etc/distro-tracker/settings/local.py according to your wishes.

3/ you must initialize the database:

   $ sudo -u distro-tracker distro-tracker migrate

4/ you must configure a webserver (see below for details on how to use
   nginx + gunicorn or apache2 + mod_wsgi).

Configuration with Nginx + Gunicorn
-----------------------------------

If you wish to use nginx, you should also install gunicorn3 (they are
probably already installed by way of dependencies unless you already had a
webserver installed).

The package provides a sample gunicorn configuration to run the Distro
Tracker application on /var/lib/distro-tracker/gunicorn.sock and the
corresponding nginx virtual host.

$ sudo apt-get install nginx gunicorn3
$ sudo cp /etc/gunicorn.d/distro-tracker.example \
          /etc/gunicorn.d/distro-tracker
$ sudo service gunicorn restart
$ sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/distro-tracker
$ sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/distro-tracker \
              /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
$ sudo service nginx restart

Configuration with Apache + mod_wsgi
------------------------------------

If you wish to use apache2, you should also install
libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3. The package provides a sample virtual host
configuration file that you can customize and enable:

$ sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
$ sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/distro-tracker
$ sudo a2enmod ssl
$ sudo a2ensite distro-tracker

What the package does for you
-----------------------------

* Create the "distro-tracker" user
* Collect static files in /var/lib/distro-tracker/static/
  (to do it yourself: sudo -u distro-tracker distro-tracker collectstatic)
* Provide ready to customize configuration files for nginx/gunicorn
  and apache/mod_wsgi
